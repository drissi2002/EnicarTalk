# EnicarTalk
The Enicartalk website is a small project that represents our unity as part of the lifestyle of our school. It helps students discover and see different perspectives and angles of ENICARTHAGE. It is not just an engineering school but also a place where one can have fun and be creative. The website provides a series of technical information about the school and our "ENICARTALK" series. It also serves as a centralized repository where you can discover events organized by our club and read blogs written by ENICar students and technology specialists.
